## Project Details

The automation tool aims to restructure and sort a given dataset. Some of the key functionalities include:

### Adding and Sorting a 'DATE' Column
This feature checks for an existing 'DATE' column in the "Raw Data" sheet and deletes it. A new 'DATE' column is then added, and the data gets sorted based on specified parameters.

```javascript
function sortRawData() { ... }
```

### Data Grouping and Error Highlighting
Groups data based on certain criteria and highlights errors (like missing usernames, invalid dates, and absent study fields).

```javascript
function SortGroup() { ... }
```

### Data Transformation
Processes the sorted data to provide total time computations for each group.

```javascript
function transformData() { ... }
```

### Data Preparation for Analysis
Creates a 'Prep Data' sheet with refined information, including total hours, check-in ID, and check-out ID.

```javascript
function preparePrepData() { ... }
```

### Creation of Monthly Data Sheets
Based on the 'Study' column in the 'Prep Data' sheet, separate monthly sheets are generated.

```javascript
function createMonthlySheets() { ... }
```
